If you want to sustain in the market then you would have to keep yourself updated with latest IT tools, and technologies:
sorces to be followed :
Technical Forums over the internet
 Technical magazines on various IT subjects 
 Technical Bulletin Boards
 Conferences, Trainings and workshops
Latest versions of old tools and packages, languages etc.

One more important issue is poor prioritization of the work.
1.If you are very good in designing software components and
your past designs have been appreciated a lot then you can think to go in technical side and become software architect.
2.If you are very good in managing things, have good command over people, 
and have great convincing abilities then you can think of going towards management 
role which will start with leading a small team.
3.If you are very good in managing things and at the same time you have great architectural sense,
then you can think of becoming techno-manager,
where you will keep contributing in designing components and will manage team and projects.
4.Once you are sure about this, 
you should start working in the same direction starting from your project preference till your trainings and certifications.
